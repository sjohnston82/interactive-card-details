## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- TailwindCSS
- React-hook-form
- Zod
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This was a fun project, I am starting to get comfortable using react-hook-form with zod to do form validation. I ended up using an online pixel ruler (https://www.rapidtables.com/web/tools/pixel-ruler.html) that I felt helped me to get the dimensions of the copy to replicate it as closely as possible.
